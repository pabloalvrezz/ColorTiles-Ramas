In this exercise, you will find an example of how we have utilized Git branches to upload files to the remote repository. 
We have leveraged Git's branching feature to create a separate branch for development, 
allowing multiple team members to work on different features simultaneously. 
Once the changes were completed and tested, we merged the branch back into the main/master branch and pushed the changes to the remote repository. 
This exercise serves as a practical demonstration of using Git branches for collaborative development and efficient version control in a team environment.
